                  <p>
                    Who would’ve guessed that Crypto would be in our faces so fast. In the first few months 2021 alone, coins literally went into phantom drive, destroying record after record... Expectations after expectation... and for those who doubted, heart after heart.
                    <br><br>The King, Bitcoin has almost tripled in value. Well-known, but smaller coins like ETH have taken the cue...  most of them going up by 20 times the initial value.
                    <br><br>But guess what?
                    <br><br>The coins no one’s heard about... you’d probably not believe it.
                    <br><br>They’re the ones doing the most. Thousands of percentage increase... from literally nowhere. 
                    <br><br>That’s why new coins are coming up by the minute. And honestly, its the best time to join. As long as the coin has got a solid business model, it’s going to blow

                  </p>

                  <h5>There’s a Reason We Chose This Name</h5>
                  <p>
                    We are Squirtmissile.
                    <br><br>You really don’t see why we call ourselves that?
                    <br><br>...
                    <br><br>Don’t expect the full deets.
                    <br><br>Just know that it’s directed UP ;-)!!
                    <br><br>Squirtmissile is the all-new, deflationary token that operates on the Binance Smart Chain. We say THE because it’s true. We’re the first people who bring this kind of life into the industry. And we’re boldly saying: The first few people that hop on now? 
                    <br><br>They’re the ones who’ll take it all.
                    <br><br>We reward you in many ways for keeping Squirtmissle, but the most obvious of those ways is... for holding it. The more they sell, the more you make, the more prices incline... and all you have to do is sit back and watch.

                  <p>
                    Let’s face it. Most shit coins today rug it the moment they smell danger. 
                    <br><br>But us? To hell with that. You better get used to seeing our name; we’re here to stay! We’ve taken all anti-gay measures in the market, and have given up ownership of the coin.
                    <br><br>It’s all up to you and the market now. Your coins are safe.
                  </p>

                    Now, lets talk numbers... and BUSINESS.
                    <br><br>Why should you give a f*ck? 
                    <br><br>Why should you buy Squirtmissile?
                    <br><br>You check for yourself...
                    <br><br>We’ve got..
                    <br><br>Total Supply: 1 Quadrillion 
                    <br><br>50% of Supply Burned (500 Trillion) 
                    <br><br>50% of Supply for PancakeSwap
                    <br><br>10% Tax on each transaction distributed back to the holders.
                    <br><br>That’s for starters! Before we’ve even started.

                  <h5>18+ Content – Our ‘Role’ to ‘Play’</h5>
                  <p>
                    You’re a f*cking genius.
                    <br><br>Yup. We’re putting porno: that multi billion dollar industry you can’t stop , onto the crypto market... if you guessed what we’re doing.
                    <br><br>Wanna know how big that is? Go check porn stats worldwide.
                    <br><br>We intend to tap into that industry.
                    <br><br>But it’s not just like normal porn sites.
                    <br><br>The NFT marketplace will allow people to post full length pornographic clips with up to 30 minutes of video, sound, and also GIFs or pictures. The material will be stored in your wallet, and on the blockchain. All you need are your wallet keys!
                    <br><br>This is different from other marketplaces. 
                    <br><br>Why?
                    <br><br>Not only will you be able to post full pornographic videos and buy them. You can send them, sell them, and collect them too. It’s going to be a complete, thriving ecosystem for open.
                    <br><br>And you know what’s even better?
                    <br><br>You can do all that COMPLETELY on ninja mode; without ever having to store anything on your computer. Finally, some unbreakable privacy for your stash...
                    <br><br>It will be the first marketplace of its kind, we will have a copyright bot developed before porn minting is open to the public. It can’t be stolen.

                    <br><br>Who else does that?!!!
                    <br><br>We reward your loyalty with bounty (in addition to the bounty). That 10% Tax on every transaction comes back to you. Multiply that by the thousands of transactions everyday, and you’ll be earning LITERALLY while you sleep.

                  <p>
                    Like most porn sites, we too want to help people earn a living through live cams personal profiles. And guess what, the earnings will be in whatever crypto they choose (preferably Squirtmissile). 
                    <br><br>So how’s that for “innovation”? We’re moving the full porn industry onto the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. And we’re sure that the results will be outstanding!

                  <h5>Price</h5>
                  <p>
                    The actual price of Squirtmissile coins, like every other coin, fluctuates based on demand and supply of the market. You’ve heard that scarcity increases prices of commodities, right?
                    <br><br>Well, with 50% of our holdings burned, there’s always a limited supply of Squirtmissile coins. There’s only one way that missile is headed. UP!
                    <br><br>As a backup, our 10% Tax reward to the holders of Squirtmissile  to push the charts up! 
                    <br><br>You have nothing to lose!                    
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We’re not hiding anything... this is going to be big! And we’re ready to test new heights the ‘missile' goes. If you ever plan to join, now is the best time to. Because we’re not in control, but we’re pretty confident that we’ll be triple our value in 1 year.
                    <br><br>Join the revolution. And make a sh*tload from it.
